### First, thanks to [Nirewen # 9011] (https://github.com/nirewen/discord-netflix) who maked the source code base, thanks!!

## Installation

Unfortunately, for now you have to run the code on your own, since I have not released a relase until the moment (if I launched it is not deleted it remind me plz)

1. You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/download) installed and added to the PATH, so just download the installer and make sure to select the box to add to PATH.

2. Download the code as zip, and run `npm install`, await until the dependencies is installed.

3. Run `electron .`.
